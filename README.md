## ðŸ”Ž Overview  
Football performance analysis is crucial for clubs to evaluate strategies, identify weaknesses, and optimize results. This project focuses on **Liverpool FCâ€™s match data** and answers key performance questions such as:  

- Does playing at home give Liverpool a significant edge?  
- How are wins, draws, and losses distributed over the season?  
- Is shot efficiency a real indicator of scoring success?  
- Do strong possession-based opponents reduce Liverpoolâ€™s goal output?  
- Does momentum from recent matches correlate with results?  

Through **bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, line plots, and box plots**, this project provides actionable insights into performance patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The project expects a CSV file named `Liverpool.csv` with columns such as:  
- `Is_Home` â†’ 1 if match at home, 0 if away  
- `Goals` â†’ Goals scored by Liverpool  
- `Opponent_Goals` â†’ Goals conceded  
- `Result` â†’ 1 (Win), 0 (Draw), -1 (Loss)  
- `Shot_Efficiency` â†’ Measure of shooting efficiency  
- `Opponent` â†’ Name of opponent club  
- `Opponent_Possession` â†’ Avg possession % of opponent  
- `Last5_Win_Rate` â†’ Win rate in last 5 matches before this game

## ðŸ“Š Analysis & Visualizations  

### 1. Home vs Away Performance Gap  
- **Question**: Does Liverpool perform significantly better at home than away?  
- **Visualization**: Side-by-side bar chart (avg goals scored & conceded at home vs away).  
- **Insight**: Highlights performance consistency across venues.  

### 2. Match Outcome Breakdown  
- **Question**: What is the distribution of Wins, Draws, and Losses?  
- **Visualization**: Pie chart with percentage breakdown.  
- **Insight**: Gives a quick overview of season performance.  

### 3. Shot Efficiency vs Goals  
- **Question**: Does higher shot efficiency lead to more goals?  
- **Visualization**: Scatter plot of `Shot_Efficiency` vs `Goals` with trend line.  
- **Insight**: Identifies whether efficiency translates into scoring.  

### 4. Opponent Strength Effect  
- **Question**: Do Liverpool struggle more against stronger possession teams?  
- **Visualization**: Line plot of opponent possession vs goals scored (highlight top 3 toughest opponents).  
- **Insight**: Helps find teams that suppress Liverpoolâ€™s attacking power.  

### 5. Last 5 Match Momentum  
- **Question**: Does recent momentum influence match outcomes?  
- **Visualization**: Boxplot of `Last5_Win_Rate` grouped by result (Win/Draw/Loss).  
- **Insight**: Shows whether form momentum predicts success.

## ðŸ“Š Results  
From the analysis, some clear insights emerge:  
- **Home vs Away** â†’ Liverpool generally scores more and concedes less at home.  
- **Match Outcomes** â†’ The pie chart shows a higher proportion of wins compared to draws and losses.  
- **Shot Efficiency** â†’ Positive correlation with goals scored, indicating efficient shooting is key.  
- **Opponent Possession** â†’ High-possession teams tend to suppress Liverpoolâ€™s scoring, with the toughest 3 highlighted.  
- **Momentum Effect** â†’ Higher last 5 match win rates are associated with more frequent wins.
